# Wanted: Community-Building Co-founder
## (Because I Can't Clone Myself)

Hi! I'm the solo founder of MarketDAO, and while I can code until the caffeine runs out, community building isn't exactly in my wheelhouse. That's where you come in.

## The Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)

MarketDAO needs someone who can turn our technical brilliance into a thriving community. I've built the product, now we need users who actually understand what it's for.

## Who I'm Looking For

You are:
- Someone who gets excited about decentralized governance (and can explain it without putting people to sleep)
- A proven community-builder who's actually done this before
- Passionate enough about MarketDAO to read our [technical docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/technical-reference/) and still want to join
- Self-motivated (because I'm busy writing code, not micromanaging)
- Capable of explaining complex concepts in ways that don't make people's eyes glaze over
- The kind of person who sees "blockchain governance" and thinks "exciting opportunity" rather than "boring buzzwords"

## The Deal

Let's be upfront:
- No salary right now (I'm not paying myself either)
- Significant token allocation when we launch on mainnet
- Equal co-founder status (this is a partnership, not a job)
- A chance to shape something potentially revolutionary from the ground up
- The satisfaction of knowing you helped build something cool

## How To Apply

Think we might be a match?

- GitHub: [Open an issue](https://github.com/evronm/marketDAO/issues) with the title "Co-founder Application" 
- Email: [Insert contact email here]

Tell me about communities you've built, why MarketDAO excites you, and maybe throw in your favorite blockchain joke (quality matters).

If you've read this far and you're still interested, we probably should talk!
